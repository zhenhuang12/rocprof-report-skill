# Skill: CUDA Kernel Profiling (B200 / Nsight Compute)

**When to use:** user asks to profile a CUDA kernel, analyze its performance, find its bottlenecks, or write an optimization plan based on Nsight Compute data. Triggers include: "profile X", "为什么这个 kernel 慢", "ncu report 说...", "下一步怎么优化", "帮我看一下这份 ncu 报告".

**Target hardware (this repo):** NVIDIA B200 (sm_100, CC 10.0, 148 SMs, 192 GB HBM3e). Most advice below is generic; B200-specific notes are explicitly marked.

## Golden rule

**Profile → Diagnose → Plan, in that order. Never guess.**

Most under-performing CUDA kernels are under-performing for exactly one reason that ncu can tell you in 10 seconds. Don't invent hypotheses before you have the report. Don't start coding a fix before you've matched the observed pattern to a known diagnosis. Don't write a wall of suggestions — rank them by evidence and expected impact.

## Quickstart (what to do when someone says "profile this kernel")

0. **Create a new run directory first** under `profile/<run_name>/` at the repo root — **one directory per run**, never reuse an existing one. Each run contains its own `harness/`, `reports/`, `analysis/`, and `REPORT.md`. This rule is mandatory in this repo. See [`reference/00-directory-layout.md`](reference/00-directory-layout.md).

1. **Decide what you're profiling.** What inputs? Which dispatch path? What question do you want answered? If the kernel takes variable-sized inputs (variable seq lengths, variable batch sizes), you must pick specific representative shapes from the user's workload — don't profile with arbitrary inputs.

2. **Build a standalone harness** unless the user is profiling through their existing binary. Harnesses compile in seconds, run the kernel in isolation, and let you use `-lineinfo` cleanly so ncu can map SASS back to source. Compile into `profile/<run_name>/harness/`. See [`reference/02-harness-guide.md`](reference/02-harness-guide.md) and the template in [`helpers/harness_template.cu`](helpers/harness_template.cu).

3. **Run two profiles**: `--set full` (with `PmSampling` sections) for the overview, and `--set source --section SourceCounters` for per-line stall attribution. Write outputs to `profile/<run_name>/reports/`. See [`reference/03-collection.md`](reference/03-collection.md).

4. **Parse with `ncu_report`** Python module — not by eye-balling the CLI. Write analysis outputs to `profile/<run_name>/analysis/`. Use the helpers in [`helpers/`](helpers/). See [`reference/04-python-api.md`](reference/04-python-api.md).

5. **Work through the six analysis dimensions.** See [`reference/05-analysis-dimensions.md`](reference/05-analysis-dimensions.md). Every one matters, but on any given kernel only 1–2 will dominate.

6. **Match patterns to the diagnosis playbook.** See [`reference/06-diagnosis-playbook.md`](reference/06-diagnosis-playbook.md). It maps NCU signal → likely cause → concrete fix, with example counts for "how big is this".

7. **Write the report** at `profile/<run_name>/REPORT.md` with evidence-backed recommendations, ranked by expected impact. See [`reference/07-report-template.md`](reference/07-report-template.md).

## Critical lessons (don't skip)

1. **The stock `ncu_profile_skill.md` metric names don't all work on B200.** Names like `smsp__inst_executed_op_global_ld.sum`, `dram__bytes.sum`, `l1tex__average_t_sectors_per_request*.ratio` return `None` on sm_100. Use the sm_100 names in [`reference/08-b200-metric-names.md`](reference/08-b200-metric-names.md) or enumerate via `action.metric_names()`.

2. **Always compile with `-lineinfo`.** Without it, ncu's source view is blank and you cannot do per-line stall analysis. If you can't add `-lineinfo` to the build system (TVM-FFI, PyTorch inline, JIT), **build a standalone harness** — that's the whole point.

3. **PM sampling is the only way to see tail effects.** Static metrics average over the whole kernel; only the time-series (either `pmsampling:` metrics or the ASCII plotter in `helpers/`) shows the shape of utilization over time.

4. **Load-imbalance on variable-length inputs is often the #1 bottleneck.** If the user's workload has sequences of varying length, per-SM active-cycle variance will often dwarf every other effect. Always check the input distribution.

5. **NCU's rule engine (`--page details`) already does half the work.** Each rule comes with `Est. Speedup: X%`. Read them first — they often point straight at the answer.

6. **Don't delegate understanding.** Run the profiles yourself, open the reports, cite specific metric values. Never write "the profile shows it's memory-bound" — instead, name the two or three metric values that back your conclusion (e.g., "`dram__bytes_read.sum.pct_of_peak_sustained_elapsed` well under 10%, and `long_scoreboard` stalls dominate the pcsamp histogram, so the kernel is **latency-bound on L1**, not DRAM-bandwidth-bound"). Fill in the actual numbers from your report. Specificity is the deliverable.
